Feel free to package `xone` for any Linux distribution or hardware you like.
Any issues regarding the packaging should be reported to the respective maintainers.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Linux (kernel 5.11+ and headers)
- DKMS
- curl (for firmware download)
- cabextract (for firmware extraction)
- wireless-regdb (Needed for wireless frequency regulatory compliance.)

### Guide

1. Unplug your Xbox devices.

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/medusalix/xone
```

3. Install `xone`:

```
cd xone
sudo ./install.sh --release
```

**NOTE:** Please omit the `--release` flag when asked for your debug logs.

4. Download the firmware for the wireless dongle:

```
sudo xone-get-firmware.sh
```

**NOTE:** The `--skip-disclaimer` flag might be useful for scripting purposes.

5. Plug in your Xbox devices.

### Updating

Make sure to completely uninstall `xone` before updating:

```
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

## Wireless pairing

Xbox devices have to be paired to the wireless dongle. They will not automatically connect to the dongle if they have been previously plugged into a USB port or used via Bluetooth.

Instructions for pairing your devices can be found [here](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/controller/connect-xbox-wireless-controller-to-pc) (see the section on *Xbox Wireless*).

## LED control

The guide button LED can be controlled via `sysfs`:

```
echo 2 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/gip*/mode
echo 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/gip*/brightness
```

Replace the wildcard (`gip*`) if you want to control the LED of a specific device.
The modes and the maximum brightness can vary from device to device.

## Troubleshooting

Uninstall the release version and install a debug build of `xone` (see installation guide).
Run `sudo dmesg` to gather logs and check for any error messages related to `xone`.
If `xone` is not being loaded automatically you might have to reboot your system.

### Error messages

- `Direct firmware load for xow_dongle.bin failed with error -2`
    - Download the firmware for the wireless dongle (see installation guide).

### Input issues

You can use `evtest` and `fftest` to check the input and force feedback functionality of your devices.

### Other problems
